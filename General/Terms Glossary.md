# Terms Glossary

This is a glossary of terms often used in interview questions and coding test assessments. Many are directly related to algorithms and data structures used to solve coding problems.

### Permutation

A permutation is an ordered arrangement of all or part of a set of objects. In a permutation, the order of the elements matters; for example, with a set {A, B, C}, the sequences “ABC” and “CAB” are considered different, even though they contain the same elements. The total number of permutations of a set of n distinct elements is given by n! (n factorial).

### Palindrome

A palindrome is a sequence—such as a word, phrase, number, or collection of characters—that reads the same forwards and backwards. Common examples include words like “racecar” and “radar.” When determining if a sequence is a palindrome, it is typical to ignore differences in casing, spacing, and punctuation in order to focus solely on the underlying characters.

### Amortized Time

Amortized time refers to the averaged cost per operation over a sequence of operations, where occasional expensive operations are offset by many inexpensive ones. This analysis is especially useful for data structures that perform a costly operation only occasionally (like array resizing in dynamic arrays). Although a single operation might, in the worst case, be slow, the average running time per operation remains efficient when considered over many operations.

### Asymptotic Runtime

Asymptotic runtime describes how the running time of an algorithm grows as the input size increases, abstracting away constant factors and lower-order terms. This concept is commonly expressed using Big O notation (e.g., O(n), O(n log n)), which provides a high-level understanding of the algorithm’s efficiency, especially for large inputs. Asymptotic analysis focuses on the “scaling behavior” of an algorithm, allowing comparisons of efficiency across different approaches as the problem size tends to infinity.

### Anagram

A word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.
