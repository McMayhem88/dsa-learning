# Example Implementations

This section holds various TypeScript examples of **data structure** and **algorithm** implementations. Each example follows a similar structure:

1. **Description**: A short overview of the example and any assumptions that it makes or additional data structures it depends on.
2. **Breakdown**: A descriptive, operational breakdown of the implementation that explains.
    - This gives you the ability to go back and look at the functionality description and try to implement it from scratch using code. Eventually, you should be able to do it even without a description, but this is a helpful stepping stone on the path to fully understanding the concepts.
3. **Code**: The actual implementation in TypeScript (hopefully well-commented).

I'll be adding more of these as I do my own reviews of the concepts.
